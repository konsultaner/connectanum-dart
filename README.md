This is a WAMP client implementation for the [dart language](https://dart.dev/) and [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) projects. 
The projects aims to provide a simple and extensible structure that is easy to use.
With this project I want return something to the great WAMP-Protocol community.

WAMP is trademark of [Crossbar.io Technologies GmbH](https://crossbario.com/).

## Other Projects

- [Connectanum java router, web and WebSocket server](https://connectanum.com), MVC-like framework, based on WAMP-Protocol
- [jsonOdm](https://github.com/konsultaner/jsonOdm), a JavaScript mongodb like in memory data(base) handler.  

## TODOs

- Multithreading for callee invocations
    - callee interrupt thread on incoming cancellations
- support auto switch auth methods for methods that need to define fields in the hello. At the moment this is only wamp scram.
- get the auth id that called a method

## Known Issues

If multiple authentication methods are used and wamp scram is one of it, wamp scram
needs to be the first one. If not wamp scram will not modify the hello as needed and will
eventually fail.

## Stream model

The transport contains an incoming stream that is usually a single subscribe stream. A session will internally
open a new broadcast stream as soon as the authentication process is successful. The transport stream subscription
passes all incoming messages to the broad cast stream. If the transport stream is done, the broadcast stream will close
as well. The broad cast stream is used to handle all session methods. The user will never touch the transport stream
directly.

## Start the client

To start a client you need to choose a transport module and connect it to the desired endpoint.
When the connection has been established you can start to negotiate a client session by calling
the `client.connect()` method from the client instance. On success the client will return a
session object.

If your transport disconnects the session will invalidate. If a reconnect is configured, the session
will try to authenticate an revalidate the session again. All subscriptions and registrations will
be recovered if possible.

```dart
import 'package:connectanum/connectanum.dart';
import 'package:connectanum/json.dart';

final client = Client(
  realm: "my.realm",
  transport: WebSocketTransport(
    "ws://localhost:8080/wamp",
    new Serializer(),
    WebSocketSerialization.SERIALIZATION_JSON
  )
);
final session = await client.connect().first;
```

## RPC

to work with RPCs you need to have an established session. 

```dart
import 'package:connectanum/connectanum.dart';
import 'package:connectanum/json.dart';

final client = Client(
  realm: "my.realm",
  transport: WebSocketTransport(
    "ws://localhost:8080/wamp",
    new Serializer(),
    WebSocketSerialization.SERIALIZATION_JSON
  )
);
final session = await client.connect().first;

// Register a procedure
final registered = await session.register("my.procedure");
registered.onInvoke((invocation) {
  // to something with the invocation
})

// Call a procedure
await for (final result in session.call("my.procedure")) {
  // do something with the result
}
```
