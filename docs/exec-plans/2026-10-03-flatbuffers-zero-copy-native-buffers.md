# FlatBuffers and zero-copy native buffers

Status: active
Started: 2026-10-03
Baseline: `54eafc5fb675886a04d390f069714c69de2aaac0`
Branch: `codex/flatbuffers-zero-copy`
Milestone: https://github.com/konsultaner/connectanum-dart/milestone/1

## Objective and scope

Complete all ten milestone issues. FlatBuffers must be a regular WAMP serializer
beside JSON, MessagePack and CBOR, with Dart/Rust interoperability, native-owned
construction, borrowed-buffer leases, lazy routing, PPT/E2EE support and measured
performance at least matching the better CBOR/MessagePack baseline on declared
representative workloads. Generic native adapter readiness is in scope; actual
ObjectBox integration belongs to a separate connectanum_objectbox_adapter package.

The primary checkout has uncommitted router embedding/shutdown work. This managed
worktree starts from committed HEAD and must not alter or claim those changes.
The previous coverage plan is deferred in this worktree by the explicit new goal;
its unfinished coverage/mutation targets remain open.

## Work order and completion evidence

- [ ] #95: pinned interoperable binding, schema generation, message/metadata map,
  independent fixtures, compatibility and negotiation rules.
- [ ] #96: native-owned buffer/model builders, freeze/transfer/retain semantics,
  allocator/base/capacity/subrange identity and copy counters.
- [ ] #97: external owner leases, owner-affine release, bounded retention and
  observable local send completion across success/error/shutdown/fan-out.
- [ ] #98: complete Dart serializer/factories/exports and verified lazy payload
  handling across VM, browser JavaScript and WASM.
- [ ] #99: native Rust codec, RawSocket ID 5 and WebSocket negotiation, metadata
  FFI integration, authenticated live RPC/pub-sub and old-ABI rejection.
- [ ] #100: homogeneous and mixed-serializer routing, delayed/progressive/error
  paths and fan-out ownership without unnecessary payload materialization.
- [ ] #101: PPT and explicit E2EE profile compatibility, unchanged CBOR profile,
  typed payload negotiation and separately accounted transformation copies.
- [ ] #102: external conformance, malformed-input/fuzz and ownership-lifetime CI.
- [ ] #103: representative throughput/latency/memory/copy budgets, repeated
  controlled runs against CBOR and MessagePack and hosted benchmark evidence.
- [ ] #104: release/consumer documentation and artifact support, generic adapter
  examples, ownership matrix and ObjectBox C boundary without adapter code.

An issue closes only after every acceptance criterion in its authoritative GitHub
body is proven. Whole milestone completion additionally requires bin/verify,
hosted CI/artifact checks and recorded performance gates. Partial fixtures or
successful round trips do not establish complete codec/runtime support.

## Current checkpoint

The worktree and branch are created. Hosted baseline CI 37062527790 and package
dry-run 37062527796 pass at the exact baseline. Pre-change bin/test-fast exits 0 in
/tmp/connectanum-flatbuffers-baseline-fast.log.

Upstream schemas and serializer source at ca1e60c7f7dd78dc2df98a3b7bdc274ae197ae9c
are inspected. Important gaps: the union ordinal is distinct from the WAMP
message ID, arbitrary options/details have no representation, Map is one string
pair, required WELCOME fields exceed the basic WAMP requirements, and schema
revisions have changed union ordering. Preserve pinned fields/tags, append an
optional metadata root field, negotiate extended semantics and reject unsupported
downgrades explicitly. Verify this extension with unmodified upstream readers.

Gemma summary completed. GLM architecture review cannot connect to its independent
local server (connection refused); focused Qwen planning is available. The first
Qwen request reached its output token limit and will be narrowed before relying
on its advice. No milestone issue is complete yet.


## Foundation implementation checkpoint

Pinned seven unchanged upstream schemas and license, checksum-verified compiler
fetching, deterministic combined schema and Dart/Rust bindings. Append-only
metadata and HEARTBEAT extensions pass flatc conformance. The checked-in binding
document maps every discriminator/dictionary, defines capability/downgrade rules
and records upstream gaps. The pinned Autobahn high-level serializer is not a
working peer; independent generated Python readers are used explicitly.

Initial generated Rust compilation fails because its Result table shadows
core::result::Result; deterministic return-type qualification fixes it. Initial
Dart2Js fixtures fail because ByteData Uint64 accessors are unsupported. Portable
two-word uint64 reads/writes preserve actual integer bits and eight-byte alignment;
unsafe values and out-of-slice access are rejected. VM and both browser compilers
pass all 32 focused tests after fixing the browser-specific bounds-error matcher.
Python/Dart/Rust bidirectional CALL and large-ID/vector checks pass; unmodified
upstream readers consume all 25 upstream union alternatives and the metadata CALL.
Native tests prove encoded payload ranges point into the input buffer.

Schema checksum/version unit tests, regeneration checks and focused analysis pass.
The complete serializer mutation wrapper/support inventories include the new
binding tests; all 79 verification-tool regressions pass. The CI workflow has a
new mandatory binding generation/independent-interop job. The pre-change
bin/test-fast completes successfully. Full bin/verify is running in session
51940 with log /tmp/connectanum-flatbuffers-foundation-verify.log. No issue is
closed, no hosted new-head evidence exists and no transport support is advertised.

Gemma summary and Qwen focused planning/review ran. Review concerns about an
append-only root field are contradicted by flatc conformance and independent
readers; the script fails explicitly if pinned schema text/hashes change. Runtime
review attempts reached the local model's output limit; GLM remains independently
unreachable. Foreign-reader and VM/JS/WASM tests remain the authoritative checks.

## Next owned-buffer stage (#96)

Current legacy native allocation is uninitialized and its adoption reconstructs a
Vec using pointer/length as both initialized length and capacity. Keep that ABI
for existing copying callers. New builder APIs need explicit allocation base,
capacity, initialized range, used offset/length and safe owned handles. Allocate
zeroed builder storage: the upstream Dart builder relies on zero padding.

A native allocator can back the internal WampFlatBufferBuilder directly. Its
public wrapper must guard every mutation after freeze/transfer and expose no raw
writable aliases. Read-only exported views require an independent retained
native owner so explicit wrapper disposal does not invalidate a surviving view.
Use handle-backed validation instead of adopting foreign or interior pointers.
Reserve capacity and account separately for downward-growth copies. Existing
Dart sends and segment sends still copy; integrate new ownership submission
without removing the ordinary Dart-value path or older-ABI explicit rejection.

Investigate fb.Builder's complete mutation surface and native-owner finalization
before exposing the callback/model API. External borrowed leases, owner-thread
release and genuine drain/completion semantics remain #97, not implicit guarantees
of an owned allocation. Do not change sources during the current verification
without recording and rerunning the checks affected by the change.

## Foundation final validation

Fresh full bin/verify exits 0 in
/tmp/connectanum-flatbuffers-foundation-verify-final.log. All 34 focused tests
pass on VM, JavaScript and WASM. Independent upstream Python readers accept
27 fixtures (all 25 union alternatives plus metadata and typed-payload CALLs);
Rust verifies the heartbeat extension too. Foreign scalar/vector reads prove
inclusive 2^53 support and correct empty-vector alignment. The earlier narrower
ID limit is reproduced fail-first and corrected. Use an underscore-prefixed
metadata capability to follow WAMP implementation-specific key conventions.
Regeneration --check and git diff --check pass. No working transport codec,
performance parity, new hosted result or whole milestone completion is claimed.

Native buffer drafts are staged outside the worktree while validating this
foundation. Rust registry design moves initialized native Vec allocations into
Bytes::from_owner, preserving original base/capacity and explicit used range;
retained/empty slices and exported finalizer tokens retain the allocation. The
Dart builder uses guarded composition, including writeListOfStructs callbacks,
so no mutable builder/allocator alias escapes. Public scalar writes block
freeze/disposal during reentrant model/list callbacks. GLM architecture requests
time out; a narrowed Qwen slice/take review completes with no arithmetic or
atomic-removal finding. Broader review attempts remain incomplete.

Coverage preflight: the two generated Dart files contribute 3,425 executable
lines, of which the binding fixtures hit 573. The coverage collector classifies
these exact compiler-provenance paths separately, preserving raw per-file and
raw overall totals; it does not lower thresholds or apply VM ignore comments to
browser data. Fail-first classification/provenance tests and all 105 selected
coverage/generation/verification-tool regressions pass. All core VM tests pass
with coverage: handwritten 6,815/7,295 (93.420%), raw including generated
7,388/10,720 (68.918%). Every existing core VM policy check passes. This new
collector-only change follows the completed full library verification and is
validated by its focused tool tests. Full browser coverage runs in session 9175,
log /tmp/connectanum-flatbuffers-foundation-browser-coverage.log; no result yet.
